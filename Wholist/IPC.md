## What can I do with Wholist IPC?

Utilising Wholist's IPC, you can create custom context menu entries on players in the "Nearby Players" list. The player
information will be passed to your plugin alongside your own `ImGuiNET` draw action, allowing you to use the information
to create custom actions that interact with the player.

## How do I use Wholist IPC?

For sake of brevity it is assumed that you already understand how to use Dalamud's IPC system. If you do not, have a
look at some other plugins that use IPC to get a better understanding of how it works.

When Wholist's IPC is available it will broadcast `Wholist.Available` which can be listened for in your own plugin. When
this is received, you can then register your own context menu entries by invoking `Wholist.RegisterPlayerContextMenu`
and then saving the returned GUID to a variable. This GUID is used to identify your context menu entries when they are
invoked and also to unregister them when you no longer need them.

You will then need to register an action to `Wholist.InvokePlayerContextMenu` which will be invoked when your context
menu is being hovered over or is active in the User Interface. This action will be passed the GUID of the context menu
entry that is being invoked as well as the character address of the character that the context menu entry is being invoked on. You
should then use this information to draw your own custom ImGuiNet elements (although please keep in mind that these
elements are drawn inside of `ImGui.BeginMenu` already.)

When you no longer need your context menu entries, you can unregister them by
invoking `Wholist.UnregisterPlayerContextMenu` and passing the GUID that was returned when you registered them, which
will remove them from the list. `Wholist.Disposed` will be broadcast when Wholist is being unloaded, so you can listen
to it and handle any cleanup that you need to do.

If you need to update your context menu entries, you will need to unregister them and then re-register them again.

If you need more information, please have a look at the source code for
the [Wholist Inbound Ipc Manager](./IntegrationHandling/InboundIpcManager.cs) which handles all of the IPC for Wholist.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
